From the controller to recoverer, there exist gRPCs as listed below:

tellVersion(int imageN, int version, int size)
Tell the recoverer the size of the file.
No return value.

chunkToSend(int imageN)
Ask for which chunks are not presented in the recoverer side.
Chunks are 1M size. We can adjust it.
Return "repeated int" as chunk numbers needed.

sendChunk(int imageN, int chunkN, bytes data, int checksum)
Send a chunk.

From the master to recoverer, there exist gRPCs as listed below:

Example:

C1(controller of Image 1): tellVersion(1, 0, 2.4M)
R2(recoverer at Node 2): returns, to tell itself ready to receive

C1: chunkToSend(1)//Ask for chunks to send, for Image 1, version 0)
R2: returns {0, 1, 2}

C1: sendChunk(1, 0, 1M data, checksum)
R2: returns

C1: sendChunk(1, 1, 1M data, checksum)
R2: returns

C1: sendChunk(1, 2, 0.4M data, checksum)
R2: returns

C1: chunkToSend(1)
R2: returns {}//complete!

C1: tellVersion(1, 1, 1.2M)
R2: returns, ready to receive

... ... ...

Hint: make sure we have the same knowledge on "bytes" and "repeated int" data types before you start.
